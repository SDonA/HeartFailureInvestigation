## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. on Anaconda (jupyter notebook)

Required Libraries are:

pandas
numpy
seaborn
scipy
sklearn
time
matplotlib


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Having experienced very close family members and friends suffer from cardiovascular related illnesses with occasional worrisome attacks, I was inspired to understand what is critical for patients who survived or died from heart attacks/failures. [Using In Hospital Mortality dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saurabhshahane/in-hospital-mortality-prediction), I was particularly interested in 

1. What are the top 3 prevalent comorbidities in HF patients and the risk level with age?
2. What are the major inter-relationships between the vital signs related to HF?
3. What are the major inter-relationships between the comorbidities related to HF?
4. What are the top 5 predictive features of mortality in HF patients?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The files neccessary to run the code are are below
1. HeartFailureInvestigation.ipynb - Main jupyter notebook file
2. data.csv - In Hospital Mortality Dataset from kaagle
3. visuals.py - Utility python code with functions used in main notebook 

The steps taking in analyzing the data is thoroughly stated in markdown cells in the main notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@succatt/key-parameters-impacting-mortality-in-heart-failure-hf-patients-a-data-driven-quest-2d9c273c46fc).
